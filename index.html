		<div>Path of darkness
</div>
		<div>Path of enlightenment
</div>
		<div>CHOOSE YOUR PATH</div>
		<div>Enter The Mind</div>
		<div>PROCEED</div>
		<div>You have chosen to enter the path of enlightenment
</div>
		<div>You have chosen to enter the dark side</div>
		<div>Go for a walk</div>
		<div>If you think you are beaten, you are.
If you think you dare not, you won't.
If you like to win, but don't think you can there's a chance you won't.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost.
For out in the world you'll find.
Succes begins with a will
It's all in a state of mind
Life battles don't always go to the stronger or faster person.
But sooner or later, the person who wins is the one who thinks they can.
time's ticking
go for a walk
</div>
		<div>I don’t want to</div>
		<div>Go for A Walk</div>
		<div>I called them</div>
		<div>Remove all distractions
get still
breathe deeply
locate your emotions
Thank them
stop trying to be perfect, you're already perfect.
The negative thoughts cannot stay like this, you are stronger.
What do you like the most about yourself?call someone you would like to say something toor
Go for a walk</div>
		<div>Maybe they were to critical when I was a child.
Maybe we would cry together when we meet.
All that I feel falls into void.
No soul to touch
No whisper to hear
Is there an end to it?



Sit somewhere and write down what you would say to your inner child.</div>
		<div>I can't</div>
		<div>Am I to critical for myself?
Do I ignore my positive qualities?
Should I be inferior to my peers?
Do I think I'm unloveable?
Is my self talk negative?
Am I just lucky with my achievements?
Do I blame myself when things go wrong, even if it's not my fault?
Do I believe their compliments?


Write 3 positive things about yourself</div>
		<div>Done</div>
		<div>RESTART</div>
		<div>You seem to be lost in your thoughts
An unknown sea of feelings
No soul to trust
Scared to be unloved

Stuck in a never ending cycle
Trapped in these moments
How can you be free?
When life in the eyes of others
Detached from your roots

Time tends to reveal
All what’s there to feel.
</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Take a walk
if the sun is shining go outside
if not
Walk through the building
think about the conversation you had over the phone

No matter how small you think it is
celebrate your accomplishments and small wins.
Celebrate the small things.
