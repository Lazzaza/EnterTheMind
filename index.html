		<div>If you think you are beaten, you are.
If you think you dare not, you won't.
If you like to win, but don't think you can there's a chance you won't.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost.
For out in the world you'll find.
Succes begins with a will
It's all in a state of mind
Life battles don't always go to the stronger or faster person.
But sooner or later, the person who wins is the one who thinks they can.

		<div>Am I to critical for myself?
Do I ignore my positive qualities?
Should I be inferior to my peers?
Do I think I'm unloveable?
Is my self talk negative?
Am I just lucky with my achievements?
Do I blame myself when things go wrong, even if it's not my fault?
Do I believe their compliments?
</div>
		<div>Maybe they were to critical when I was just a child.
Ask someone to help you write these things about you.
