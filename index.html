		<div>Path of darkness
</div>
		<div>Path of enlightenment

		<div>CHOOSE YOUR PATH</div>

		<div>PROCEED</div>
		<div>You have chosen to enter the path of enlightenment
</div>
		<div>You have chosen to enter the dark side</div>
		<div>Go for a walk</div>
		<div>If you think you are beaten, you are.
If you think you dare not, you don't.
If you like to win, but don't think you can there's a chance you won't.
If you think you'll lose, you're lost.
For out in the world you'll find.
Succes begins with a will
It's all in a state of mind
Life battles don't always go to the stronger or faster person.
But sooner or later, the person who wins is the one who thinks they can.
time's ticking
go for a walk
</div>
		<div>I don’t want to</div>
		<div>Go for A Walk</div>
		<div>I called them</div>
		<div>Remove all distractions
get still
breathe deeply
locate your emotions
Thank them
stop trying to be perfect, you're already perfect.
The negative thoughts cannot stay like this, you are stronger.
What do you like the most about yourself?call someone you would like to say something toor
Go for a walk</div>
		<div>Maybe they were to critical when I was a child.
Maybe we would cry together when we meet.
All that I feel falls into void.
No soul to touch
No whisper to hear
Is there an end to it?



Sit somewhere and write down what you would say to your inner child.</div>
		<div>I can't</div>
		<div>Am I to critical for myself?
Do I ignore my positive qualities?
Should I be inferior to my peers?
Do I think I'm unloveable?
Is my self talk negative?
Am I just lucky with my achievements?
Do I blame myself when things go wrong, even if it's not my fault?
Do I believe their compliments?


Write 3 positive things about yourself</div>
		<div>Done</div>
		<div>RESTART</div>
		<div>You seem to be lost in your thoughts
An unknown sea of feelings
No soul to trust
Scared to be unloved

Stuck in a never ending cycle
Trapped in these moments
How can you be free?
When you live in the eyes of others
Detached from your roots

you hesitate to prioritize your needs and safety
you struggle to treat yourself with unconditional love and compassion
you’re always listening to the naggy, criticizing voice in your head

</div>
		<div>
</div>
		<div>Take a walk
if the sun is shining go outside
if not
Walk through the building
think about the conversation you had over the phone

No matter how small you think it is
celebrate your accomplishments.
Celebrate the small things.

		<div>START</div>
		<div>Hey,
I’m glad you’re here.
You can leave this place now.
I made a little game for you.
You can play it while walking around
hopefully helping you gaining more 
self-trust. Or not...
You will be given assignments,
you can choose to do it or don’t. it’s up to you
Press the red buttons to proceed.
Turn off silent mode and turn your volume up
or use headphones.
You don’t have to write things down
You can also do it in your head
Try to reach the end
When you’re ready press
</div>
		<div>Reduce all expectations.
Learn how to let things occur naturally
Avoid thinking about the results and proceed
With an open mind
Don’t waste energy on things you can’t control
</div>
		<div>Wrote it</div>
		<div>I have no goals</div>
		<div>Silence your inner critic

Whenever you hear this voice in your head, say "Thank you. You used to be helpful, and I am grateful for that. But now we need to part ways. There are different voices in me that I want to listen to now. My courageous voice. My agile voice. My mature voice."

There are never enough things you can do to make something “better”there are never enough people you can pleasethere are never enough responsibilities you can take on.
Write down some goals you would like to achieve</div>
		<div>No</div>
		<div>I know you don’t have a lot of spare time up your sleeves on most days. I understand you have a trillion things on your plate.

But can you pause and take a breath for a while?

If you really want to know how to trust yourself, you need to take a break from the hustle and discover your inner purpose, knowing, and joy.

Listen to the silence. Feel the rhythm of your heart. Dig deep into the truth of who you are.

You’re almost there…
just a few steps to go

U got this

Make a list of things you like about yourself. Go crazy, and don’t set your bar too high
</div>
		<div>Find this path.Pick a stone from itHold a thought to the stone
you want to let go off

There should be water somewhere near
go find it.
</div>
		<div>PROCEED
</div>
		<div>As you throw the stone in the water,
You watch the ripples stretch out.
Realizing you’ve come a far way

Relax, you more worthy than you would think.
Even if you don’t think so :)
</div>
		<div>END</div>
		<div>Congratulations you’ve reached
The end!
I’m so proud of you and so should you!

Whenever you feel 
insecure, overwhelmed, and overly conscious, 
remind yourself that it’s okay to be YOU.
 There’s nothing wrong with 
letting people see who you really are.

I understand that being vulnerable can be scary.
 Take one step at a time and risk it. 
Eventually, you’ll learn how to trust yourself 
as your feelings of insecurity fade away.
